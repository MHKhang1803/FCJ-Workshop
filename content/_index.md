# Global Load Balancing with Route 53 and Health Checks

#### Overview
**Global Load Balancing with Route 53 and Health Checks** focuses on building an intelligent and reliable global traffic distribution system using AWS's Route 53 DNS service. By combining techniques like **Weighted Routing**, **Geolocation Routing**, and **Failover Routing** with **Health Checks**, the system can automatically redirect users to the nearest, healthiest, or proportionally loaded servers. The project's goal is to ensure high availability, efficient load distribution, and improved global access performance for applications or websites.
