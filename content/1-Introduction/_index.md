#### Overview
**Global Load Balancing with Route 53 and Health Checks** aims to build a global load balancing solution based on AWS's DNS serviceâ€”Amazon Route 53. By using features such as **Weighted Routing**, **Geolocation Routing**, and **Failover Routing** combined with **Health Checks**, the system can automatically direct users to the most suitable server based on geographical location, operational status, or predefined load policies. This enhances the availability, access performance, and resilience of applications on a global scale.

#### Route 53
**Amazon Route 53** is a managed DNS (Domain Name System) service from AWS that provides fast, reliable, and highly scalable domain name resolution. Route 53 allows users to route traffic to servers, applications, or other AWS resources based on various policies, such as geography, weighted distribution, and the health status of the endpoint. The service also supports domain registration and management, helping businesses build a global network infrastructure with high performance and optimal availability.

#### EC2
**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is an AWS cloud computing service that allows users to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) flexibly and on-demand. With EC2, users can easily deploy applications, store data, configure operating systems, and scale their infrastructure as needed. The service supports various instance types suitable for different purposes, such as web servers, data processing, or machine learning, helping to reduce costs and optimize operational performance.
